# COMSOC: Python Package for Computational Social Choice

This is a Python package implementing various tools for researchers working in Computational Social Choice \[1\], and specifically voting theory. Its aim is to provide a framework for projects requiring access to SAT solvers to reason about axioms and voting rules \[2\]. 

The package also provides a library for the automated justification of voting outcomes \[3,4,5\], as well as the code of a [web application](https://demo.illc.uva.nl/justify) that allows users to search for axiomatic justifications for a given outcome in a small-scale voting scenario. 

For a more in-depth introduction to the code, consult the sample Python notebook [`Example.ipynb`](https://github.com/comsoc-amsterdam/comsoc/blob/main/Example.ipynb).
