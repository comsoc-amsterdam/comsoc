# COMSOC: A Python framework for Computational Social Choice

This is a Python package implementing various tools for researchers working in Computational Social Choice, specifically voting theory. Its aim is to provide a framework for projects requiring access to SAT solvers to reason about axioms and voting rules. Furthermore, it also provides a library for the automated justification of voting outcomes [[1]](#1), as well as the code of a web application that allows users to search for justifications for small-scale voting scenarios (https://demo.illc.uva.nl/justify). For a more in-depth introduction to the code, consult the example Python notebook (`Example.ipynb`).
