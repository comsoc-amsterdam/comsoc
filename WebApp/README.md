To run this, you need to install [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/). Then, run the following commands (in the folder where `web.py` is located):

    export FLASK_APP=web
    flask run

Then, you should connect to the link that you will see on the console (probably http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ).
